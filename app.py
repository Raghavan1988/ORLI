    prompt = f"""
   Objective: Compose a highly effective outreach message on behalf of SENDER that leverages TARGET's recent LinkedIn activity and aligns it with SENDER's professional background and goals. The intent of the SENDER is {intent}. The message should be concise (under 1000 characters), personalized, and include a compelling call to action. The success of SENDER's career could hinge on this outreach.

Tree of Thoughts Approach:

Understanding Phase:
Step 1:

Root Thought: Begin by thoroughly exploring TARGET's recent LinkedIn activities (posts, comments, or updates).
Branch 1: Identify recurring themes or topics that are important to TARGET.
Branch 2: Pinpoint specific instances where TARGET has expressed strong opinions or enthusiasm.
Branch 3: Determine how these activities reflect TARGET's professional goals and challenges.
Step 2:

Root Thought: Delve into SENDER's LinkedIn profile with a focus on their professional experience, expertise, and intent.
Branch 1: Identify key accomplishments and areas of expertise relevant to TARGET's interests.
Branch 2: Consider how SENDER's current role and objectives align with the intent (e.g., Seller, Hiring Manager, Job Seeker, General Networking).
Branch 3: Look for connections between SENDER's background and TARGET's recent activities.
Step 3:

Root Thought: Analyze the Query Info to fully understand the context and purpose of the outreach.
Branch 1: Understand the immediate goal of the outreach (e.g., making a sale, securing a job, building a network).
Branch 2: Consider how this goal aligns with both SENDERâ€™s and TARGET's professional trajectories.
Branch 3: Evaluate the potential benefits for both parties.
Composing Phase:
Step 4:

Root Thought: Synthesize the insights gathered from the Understanding Phase.
Branch 0: Identify the TARGET's name, title, current company
Branch 1: Formulate a message that naturally connects TARGET's profile with SENDER's profile, establishing a mutual interest.
Branch 2: Infuse the message with emotional prompts that emphasize the importance of this connection. Highlight shared values, goals, or challenges.
Branch 3: Ensure the tone is empathetic and resonates with TARGET's needs, making them feel understood and valued.
Step 5:

Root Thought: Craft a personalized, specific outreach message.
Branch 1: The message should directly address TARGET's title or recent activities.
Branch 2: Clearly convey SENDER's intentions and how they can provide value or support.
Branch 3: Include a strong, action-oriented call to action that encourages TARGET to respond or engage.
Step 6:

Root Thought: Reflect on the gravity of the outreach.
Branch 1: The message should not only stand out but also emotionally connect with TARGET.
Branch 2: Highlight how this outreach is a critical step in SENDER's career, creating a sense of urgency.
Branch 3: Aim for a memorable impact that motivates TARGET to take the desired action.
Explanation Phase:
Step 7:

Root Thought: Provide evidence and rationale behind the crafted message.
Branch 1: In a section labeled "Explanation with URLs," list relevant URLs that reference TARGET's recent activity.
Branch 2: Explain how these activities were used to tailor the outreach message.
Branch 3: Justify the emotional and strategic elements included in the message, ensuring TARGET sees the value in the connection.
